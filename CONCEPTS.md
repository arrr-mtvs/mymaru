# Core Concepts: Conversation & Message

## Conversation

**Definition:**
A Conversation is a container or thread that groups together a sequence of messages exchanged between the user and the AI (or between users, in a multi-user system).

**Purpose:**
It represents a single chat session or topic. Each conversation can have a title, a creation date, and a unique identifier.

**Example:**
- "Trip Planning with AI"
- "Debugging Python Code"
- "Recipe Suggestions"

**Typical fields for a Conversation entity/model:**
- `id` (unique identifier)
- `title` (optional, e.g., "My First Chat")
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `user_id` (if multi-user)
- (possibly) `archived`, `pinned`, etc.

## Message

**Definition:**
A Message is a single unit of communication within a conversation. It can be sent by the user or generated by the AI.

**Purpose:**
It represents one turn in the chat, such as a question, a response, or a system notification.

**Example:**
- User: "What's the weather like today?"
- AI: "It's sunny and 25Â°C in your area."

**Typical fields for a Message entity/model:**
- `id` (unique identifier)
- `conversation_id` (links the message to its conversation)
- `sender` (e.g., "user" or "ai")
- `content` (the text of the message)
- `created_at`
- (optionally) `type` (text, image, etc.), `status` (sent, delivered, etc.)

## Relationship

- **One Conversation** contains **many Messages**.
- Each **Message** belongs to **one Conversation**.

### Visual Example

```
Conversation: "Trip Planning"
  - Message 1: User: "Where should I go in Japan?"
  - Message 2: AI: "Tokyo and Kyoto are great options!"
  - Message 3: User: "What's the best time to visit?"
  - Message 4: AI: "Spring and autumn are ideal."
